## My process

1. Created sketch on how to structure it.
2. Created html structure.
3. Wrote CSS code top-down for desktop view.
4. Created hover animation.
5. Added CSS code for mobile media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What was new to me in this project was CSS animations. Furthermore, I used new properties in CSS to broaden and deepen my knowledge like border-radius and box-shadow. 

Apart from that and due to the project's size, it was a nice little exercise to practice a very concise and structured approach to design, conceptualize and implement this card.   

```css
box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);

@media (min-width: 376px) {
    .card:hover {
        box-shadow: 14px 14px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
    }
}
```
